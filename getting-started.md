🔄 How to Do This in GitHub (Web Only)
Since you’re using the web interface (with the cat/octocat logo):

Go to your repo → Click Add file → Create new file.

Name it e.g. about.md, then paste the text you convert from PDF.

Commit directly to main.

Repeat for each section (getting-started.md, setup.md, etc.).

Edit README.md last to link all the files.

👉 Now your PDF is a hyperlinked, version-controlled online guide instead of a static document.

⚡ Next step suggestion: Do you want me to prepare the Markdown skeleton files (with section headers from your PDF already filled in), so you just need to paste/edit the text from the PDF into GitHub?

That way you skip the “blank page” problem.
