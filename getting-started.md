üîÑ How to Do This in GitHub (Web Only)
Since you‚Äôre using the web interface (with the cat/octocat logo):

Go to your repo ‚Üí Click Add file ‚Üí Create new file.

Name it e.g. about.md, then paste the text you convert from PDF.

Commit directly to main.

Repeat for each section (getting-started.md, setup.md, etc.).

Edit README.md last to link all the files.

üëâ Now your PDF is a hyperlinked, version-controlled online guide instead of a static document.

‚ö° Next step suggestion: Do you want me to prepare the Markdown skeleton files (with section headers from your PDF already filled in), so you just need to paste/edit the text from the PDF into GitHub?

That way you skip the ‚Äúblank page‚Äù problem.
